        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Asynchronous programming is a powerful concept that allows programs to
            handle multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the main execution
            thread. This approach is essential for creating efficient, responsive
            applications, particularly in web development.

        <h2>What is Asynchronous Programming?</h2>
        <p>
            In a synchronous programming model, tasks are executed sequentially, one
            after the other. This can lead to inefficiencies, especially when tasks
            involve waiting for I/O operations like file reading or network requests.
            Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, allows a program to initiate
            a task and then move on to other tasks before the initial one is complete.

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Callbacks:</strong> Functions passed as arguments to other
                functions, executed after the completion of a task.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Promises:</strong> Objects representing the eventual completion
                (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, allowing chaining of actions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Async/Await:</strong> Syntactic sugar over promises, providing a
                more readable and concise way to write asynchronous code.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example Code Snippets</h2>
        <h3>Using Callbacks</h3>

        <!-- <pre> ensures that the indentation, line breaks, and white spaces are preserved. -->
        <!-- <code> semantically marks the content as code. -->

        <pre><code>function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        callback('Data received');
    }, 2000);
}

fetchData((message) => {
    console.log(message); // Data received
});</code></pre>

        <h3>Using Promises</h3>
        <pre><code>function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve('Data received');
        }, 2000);
    });
}

fetchData()
    .then((message) => {
        console.log(message); // Data received
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
    });</code></pre>
        <h3>Using Async/Await</h3>
        <pre><code>async function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve('Data received');
        }, 2000);
    });
}

async function getData() {
    try {
        const message = await fetchData();
        console.log(message); // Data received
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}

getData();</code></pre>

        <h2>Benefits of Asynchronous Programming</h2>
        <p>
            By using asynchronous programming, developers can improve the performance
            and responsiveness of their applications. This is particularly beneficial
            for web applications that need to handle multiple simultaneous user
            interactions without delays.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding and implementing asynchronous programming is crucial for
            modern software development. By mastering this technique, developers can
            create more efficient, responsive, and user-friendly applications.
